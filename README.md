# basic-amazon-clone-front-end-project

This is my very first practice project, a simple copy of Amazon (https://www.amazon.com/), made with HTML and CSS. I used Visual Studio to write the code. It's basic, but it's a start for me in learning web development. I'll be working on more practice projects soon!
