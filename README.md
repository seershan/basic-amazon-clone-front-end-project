# Simple Amazon Clone

Welcome to my first practice project! This is a basic clone of Amazon created using HTML and CSS. It's a beginner-friendly attempt at web development, built with Visual Studio.

## Features

- Mimics the layout and design of Amazon's homepage.
- Uses HTML for structuring and CSS for styling.
- Provides a simple introduction to web development concepts.

## Future Improvements

This project is just the beginning. In the future, I plan to:

- Add more functionality to mimic Amazon's features.
- Refine the design and layout for a more polished look.
- Incorporate JavaScript to make the clone interactive.
